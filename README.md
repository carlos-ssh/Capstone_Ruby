# About 

The main concept of this Capstone, it's building Linters for Ruby, the project provides feedback about errors or warnings in code. 
Built completely with Ruby following best practices maintaining good coding standards working DIY and managing the version control with Gitflow.


# Ruby Linter
It checks, the following errors & warnings.
- check empty line error
- check for trailing spaces
- check missing/unexpected end
- check for missing/unexpected tags i.e. '( )', '[ ]', and '{ }'
- check for wrong indentation

> Below are demonstrations of good and bad code for the above cases. I will use the pipe '|' symbol to indicate cursor position where necessary.

## Trailing spaces
> note where the cursor(|) is on the bad code 
~~~ruby
# Good Code

  def initialize(venue, date)

    @venue = venue
    @date = [[date]
  end

## Built With
- Ruby
- RSpec for Ruby Testing


# Getting Started

To get a local copy of the repository please run the following commands on your terminal:

```
$ cd <folder>
```

```
$ git clone https://github.com/carlos-ssh/Capstone_Ruby.git
```

**To check for errors on a file:** 

~~~bash
$ bin/main ./bugs/bug.rb
~~~

## Testing

To test the code, run `rspec` from root of the folder using terminal.
Note: `bug.rb` has been excluded from rubocop checks to allow RSpec testing without interfering with Gitflow actions

> Rspec is used for the test, to install the gem file, run

~~~bash
$ bundle install 
~~~

> But before that, make sure you have **bundler** installed on your system, else run

~~~bash
$ gem install bundler 
~~~

> or you simply install the the following directly using 

~~~bash
$ gem install rspec 
~~~

~~~bash
$ gem install colorize 
~~~
